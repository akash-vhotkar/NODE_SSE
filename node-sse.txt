SSE = Server Sent Events 

Flow  = connection flows from server to client 
support  = it is supported by all browsers 

Definanation 
SSE is protocol 
Sse protocol which help use to make persisitent and alive  unidirectional connection between the server and client 


How the sse works
SSE works by making persisitent and open  HTTP connection   between  the server and client.

Connection type  = unidirectional 
The connection keep alive untill it is closed from server
The connection from client to server will auto sync once it is made from client 
Here the server can sent message from server to client  but client cannot sent message to server 
Here the client and server  both can close connection at any point of time 
client site  = eventSource.close();
server site = response.end();


Response Headers sync 
res.writeHead(200, {
    "Connection": "keep-alive",
    "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
});


client site 
EventSource interface is used make persistent  open connection between server and client 
eventssource  options 
withCredentials =  to setup the cors policy 
There will be an event listners for events  sent by the  server 


Use Case 
SSE is used to file  uploading progress 
SSE is used  any where we need to track the progress and events happning over the backend 

Compression case  server site 
The compression middleware used to  compress the response
res.flush() method to force the partially-compressed response to be flushed to the client.
